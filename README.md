# Steam App Version Checker

I built this simple script to check for Valheim server updates and notify me if one is found.
To use it, you just need to copy `settings_example.py` to a new file named `settings.py` and
edit the fields within to use your tokens.

You should also be able to adapt the script to monitor a different app by changing the APP_ID
in your `settings.py`, but I have not tested this personally.
